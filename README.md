# Power Meter

This is a experimental project to read multiple PZEM004T in the same UART(Multi TX drop, using hardware serial). It buffers the readings and redirect(Using the same PZEM004T protocol) to I2C/SPI(Not defined yet).

As soon as I have more time I'll update this project with schematics, etc.
