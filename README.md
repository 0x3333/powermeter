# Power Meter

This is a experimental project to read multiple PZEM004T in the same UART(Multi TX drop, using Software serial). It then redirect(Using the same PZEM004T protocol) to the hardware UART using a higher baud rate.

As soon as I have more time I'll update this project with schematics, etc.
